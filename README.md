#Speech Emotion Recognition

This project aims to recognize the emotional state of a person based on their speech using machine learning techniques. The goal is to develop a model that can accurately classify speech into different emotional categories, such as happy, sad, angry, and neutral. The application of this technology can be used in a wide range of domains, including healthcare, education, entertainment, and customer service.

The project is implemented in Python using various libraries, including TensorFlow, Librosa, and NumPy. The dataset used in this project is the Ryerson Audio-Visual Database of Emotional Speech and Song (RAVDESS), which contains speech data recorded in a sound-proof studio by actors simulating different emotions.

The data is preprocessed, cleaned, and transformed to prepare it for modeling. The audio signals are converted into a spectrogram representation, which is a visual representation of the sound wave. The model is trained using various deep learning algorithms, including Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), and their combinations.

The model is evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. The project also provides a web-based interface for users to input audio files and get the predicted emotional category.

To use this project, users can download the code and dataset, and run it on their local machine. Users can modify the code to experiment with different algorithms, hyperparameters, and feature combinations. The project is designed to be easily extensible and can be adapted to different use cases and domains.

In conclusion, this project provides a useful tool for recognizing emotional states based on speech data, and can be applied in a wide range of domains. The deep learning models used in this project can achieve high accuracy and can be fine-tuned for specific use cases. The web interface also makes it easy for users to interact with the model and get predictions in real-time.
